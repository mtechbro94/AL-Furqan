# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

To deploy your Next.js app for free, you can use platforms like:

*   **Vercel:** ([https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)): It is the easiest platform to deploy Next.js apps. Connect your git repository and every push will be deployed automatically.
*   **Netlify:** ([https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)): Connect your git repository and every push will be deployed automatically.
*   **Firebase Hosting:** ([https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)): Well integrated with Firebase, it requires building the app and deploying using the Firebase CLI.

These platforms typically offer free tiers suitable for personal projects.

**Manual Deployment Required:** I am unable to directly deploy the app for you. Deployment requires access to hosting platforms and your credentials. Please manually deploy the app using one of the options mentioned above.
