To deploy this Next.js application, follow these general steps depending on your hosting provider:

**Vercel or Netlify (Recommended):**

1.  **Connect your repository:** Sign up for an account on Vercel ([https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)) or Netlify ([https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)). Connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to the platform.
2.  **Configure deployment settings:**
    *   Vercel usually autodetects the Next.js project and configures the settings automatically.
    *   Netlify might require you to specify the build command (`next build`) and the publish directory (`out` or `.next`).
3.  **Deploy:** The platform will automatically deploy your application whenever you push changes to your repository.

**Firebase Hosting:**

1.  **Install Firebase CLI:** If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
2.  **Login to Firebase:**

    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```
3.  **Initialize Firebase in your project:** Run the following command in your project directory:

    ```bash
    firebase init hosting
    ```

    *   Select "Use an existing project" and choose your Firebase project.
    *   Specify "public" as your public directory (or `out` if using `next export`).
    *   Configure as a single-page app (yes).
    *   Do not set up automatic deploys with GitHub (unless you want that).
4.  **Build your Next.js app:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
5.  **Deploy to Firebase Hosting:**

    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Environment Variables:**  If your application relies on environment variables (like `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`), make sure to configure them in your hosting provider's settings.
*   **Free Tier Limits:** Be mindful of the free tier limitations of each platform, such as bandwidth, build minutes, and storage.
*   **Server Actions:** Next.js Server Actions might require specific configurations depending on the deployment platform. Check the platform's documentation for details.
